## Quickstart

Before you start, make sure you have Redis installed and running at 127.0.0.1:6379

Install dependencies first.
```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
```

Setup environment.
```bash
$ grunt build
```

Create your user account
```bash
$ node ./scripts/setup.js
```

OR create your .env file
```
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=yourGAID
PRERENDER_TOKEN=yourPrerender.ioToken
COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=yourCoveralls.ioToken
MAILER_EMAIL_ID=SMTP_Injection
MAILER_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
MAILER_PASSWORD=your_sparkpost_apikey
MAILER_SERVICE_PROVIDER=SparkPost
BASE_URL=yourdomain.com
DSN_KEY=yourPrivateRavenKey
```

Side note: ___Currently we are using Raven and Sentry [https://www.getsentry.com](https://www.getsentry.com) for error logging. To use it you must provide a valid private DSN key in your .env file and a public DSN key in app/views/layout.index.html___

Create this directory or you will get errors.

```
mkdir uploads/pdfs
```

Edit the `env` config in gruntfile.js to make sure your .env file is being used. If you don't include this your app won't run

To run development version:

Set ```NODE_ENV=development``` in .env file
```$ grunt```

To run production version:

Set ```NODE_ENV=production``` in .env file
```$ grunt```

Your application should run on port 3000 or the port you specified in your .env file, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)


## Testing Your Application
You can run the full test suite included with MEAN.JS with the test task:

```
$ grunt test
```

This will run both the server-side tests (located in the app/tests/ directory) and the client-side tests (located in the public/modules/*/tests/).

To execute only the server tests, run the test:server task:

```
$ grunt test:server
```

And to run only the client tests, run the test:client task:

```
$ grunt test:client
```

Currently the live example uses heroku github deployments. The Docker file is out of date and does not work. If someone wishes to get it working feel free to submit a pull request.

To calculate your total test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task
```bash
$ grunt coverage
```

To calculate your server-side test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task
```bash
$ grunt coverage:server
```

To calculate your client-side test coverage with Istanbul, run the coverage task
```bash
$ grunt coverage:client
```
